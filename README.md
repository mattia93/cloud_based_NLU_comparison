# Cloud based NLU comparison
Datasets and code used in creating a performance comparison between cloud-based NLU services.

The dataset is in **Italian** and is composed of anonymized interactions between users and human operators that work for [Mega Italia Media](https://www.megaitaliamedia.com/it/).

This approach was published in *A performance comparison of different cloud-based Natural Language Understanding Services for an Italian e-Learning Platform* (currently under final review phase)
